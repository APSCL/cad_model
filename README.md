CAD Models for 3D Printing

## Design
### Revision 2
Revision 1 faced numerous manufacturing challenges at TIW including print time and print quality. Revision 2 intends to solve these issues by making the parts more modular, standardized, and printable. This revision uses a 13 cm x 13 cm mounting hole design, allowing for universal compatibility of different parts created. The hole diameter is 0.55 cm while the connecting pins have a diameter of 0.45 cm.
