## Design
### Revision 3
Revision 2 required tight tolerances, which made manufacturing and adjusting hard. Revision 3 solves this issue by relying on nuts and bolts instead of friction based pins. This revision also reduces plate size for faster prints and easier access to ports and wires. It also features the new mount for the Raspberry Pi instead of the Jetson Nano. The holes are sized for M2.5 screws. This should also make the structure stronger and easier to work on.

### Revision 2
Revision 1 faced numerous manufacturing challenges at TIW including print time and print quality. Revision 2 intends to solve these issues by making the parts more modular, standardized, and printable. This revision uses a 13 cm x 13 cm mounting hole design, allowing for universal compatibility of different parts created. The hole diameter is 0.55 cm while the connecting pins have a diameter of 0.45 cm.

### Revision 1
Revision 1 featured complete tables per stage. LIDAR mount was modular via a square cutout.
